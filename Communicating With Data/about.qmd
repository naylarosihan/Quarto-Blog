Nayla Rosihan\
\
I am Nayla Rosihan, a final year business student at Monash University, majoring in Business Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Information Technology. Born in Sydney and raised in Melbourne, I am deeply connected to my Indonesian heritage. As a practicing Muslim, I am committed to community involvement and ethical pursuits. I have a strong passion for exploring new ideas and technologies, which I actively integrate into my dedication to helping non-profit organizations. My academic and personal interests merge to enable me to bring a diverse and innovative perspective to my studies and volunteer efforts.
