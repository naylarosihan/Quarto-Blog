# Communicating With Data

## Overview
"Communicating With Data" is a blog where I, Nayla Rosihan, blend complex data analysis with clear, insightful narratives to explore the implications of data across various sectors. As a final-year Business Statistics and IT student at Monash University, this blog serves as a canvas for my analytical explorations and a bridge to connect with like-minded data enthusiasts.

## Project Description
This repository contains the data, scripts, and methodologies used in the blog posts for "Communicating With Data." The focus is on applying statistical techniques to real-world data, providing both academic insights and practical applications. 

### Featured Analysis: Childcare Cost Stability in Economic Downturns
This project investigates the paradox of childcare costs in the United States, which remain high despite economic downturnsâ€”a phenomenon contrary to typical market expectations.

#### Data Source
- **Dataset**: National Database of Childcare Prices, maintained by the Department of Labor.

#### Variables
- **Unemployment Rate (16 and older)**: Measures the health of the labor market.
- **Median Childcare Cost (Infants)**: Reflects the financial impact on families.

#### Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed 10,974 rows with non-finite values or outliers.
- **Data Standardization**: Standardized column names and included state abbreviations for detailed regional analysis.

#### Visualizations
- **Figure 1**: Stability of median childcare costs against unemployment rates, color-coded by state.
- **Table 1**: Overview of childcare costs and unemployment rates by state.

### Insights
Despite expectations, our analysis shows that childcare costs are insulated from economic downturns, suggesting an inelastic demand for childcare services.
